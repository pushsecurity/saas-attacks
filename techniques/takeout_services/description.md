# Takeout services

## Tactics
* Exfiltration

## Summary
Takeout services allow users to export all of their data from a SaaS app into a downloadable format. This is often used to satisfy compliance with GDPR which requires that data subjects maintain ownership of their data.

An adversary can make use of this functionality to quickly and easily exfiltrate a very complete set of data from a SaaS app.
